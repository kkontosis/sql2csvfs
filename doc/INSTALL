libsql2text INSTALLATION

An easy way to build sql2textfs is to use the `buildsql2text.sh` script
which handles downloading and building the special dependencies automatically.
The following instructions give details for a manual installation.

1. Requirements
================================================================================

sql2textfs currently compiles only on POSIX systems.
It has been tested in a Ubuntu Linux 9.04.

The programs needed to compile sql2textfs are:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	g++
	make
	libpcre development package
	libpcre++ development package
	libfuse development package
	fusermount from fuse-utils package
	pkg-config
	unixodbc development package
	libmysqlclient development package
	libsqlite3 development package
	libpq development package 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	libcppdb
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	libretranse
	libsql2text
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that in different systems, the package names may vary.

The library libcppdb is part of the cppcms project and has separate
installation instructions. See also: http://cppcms.com

The libraries libretranse and libsql2text are part of the same project as 
sql2textfs and has separate installation instructions.

In order to build sql2textfs, the projects
	cppdb
	retranse
	libsql2text

need to be placed in the parent directory of the one that contains sql2textfs
with the exact names `cppdb`, `retranse` and `sql2text`.
Listing the parent directory should look like this:

	cppdb
	retranse
	sql2text
	sql2textfs

Before building sql2textfs make sure that cppdb, retranse and libsql2text
have been built.


2. Installation
================================================================================

Before building it is necessary to have an sql2textfs directory side by side 
with its pre-compiled dependencies as described above.
Go to the sql2textfs directory and type:

	make

The sql2textmount program will be compiled.
After that, if you wish to install the program into /usr/local type:

	sudo make install

and the sql2textmount program together with the sql2textfs configuration
files in /etc/sql2text will be installed.


3. Unstalling sql2textfs
================================================================================

To remove sql2textfs from /usr/local go to the source code directory
and type:

	sudo make uninstall
